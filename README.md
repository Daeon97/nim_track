# nim_track

Nimtrack is a mobile app interface for an IoT-enabled animal tracking system. The app aims to 
effectively track and monitor animal health, facilitating the effective management of the 
livestock herding process. NimTrack is powered by an Amplify backend that stores and retrieves
data to/from a DynamoDB database over an AppSync GraphQL API. The GraphQL API schema can be found
in the [amplify/backend/api/NimTrack/schema.graphql](https://github.com/Daeon97/nim_track/blob/dev/amplify/backend/api/NimTrack/schema.graphql)
directory
